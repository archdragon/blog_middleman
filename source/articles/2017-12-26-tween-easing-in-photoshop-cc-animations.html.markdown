Unfortunately it looks like automatic easing is **not currently possible** in Photoshop.

If you want to add easing to your animation you can:

* Add easing by manually modifying frames in your Photoshop timeline.
* Use a Photoshop plugin to generate easing automatically (ie. https://github.com/timothywhalin/Photoshop-Easing-Script - I've not tested it yet).
* Export your layers/images to another application (ie. Adobe Animate CC)  and edit them there (this is my preferred approach).
